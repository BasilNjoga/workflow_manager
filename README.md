# worklflow_manager
A web application to help you manage and set reminders for tasks, deadlines and the workflow involved

#What problem does this solve
As a student and i would similarly for people working, sometimes you have tasks that require several steps
and cant all be perfomed in one sitting. A workflow app would help you set reminders for events, tasks and assignment 
deadlines allowing you to diversify the reminders adding steps you require to perfom to fully fulfill the task or job.
The tasks can further be highlighted in terms of priority , hence you receive regular emails or text reminders for higher priority jobs and your dashboard shows jobs in terms of priority and deadlines.
