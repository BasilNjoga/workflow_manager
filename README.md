# worklflow_manager
A web application to help you manage and set reminders for tasks, deadlines while breaking them down into the workflow involved

# What problem does this solve
As a student and for most organizations, sometimes you have tasks that require several steps and
and cant all be perfomed in one sitting. A workflow app would help you set reminders for events, tasks and assignment 
deadlines allowing you to diversify the reminders adding steps you require to perfom to fully fulfill the task or job.
The tasks can further be highlighted in terms of priority , hence you receive regular emails or text reminders for higher priority jobs and your dashboard shows jobs in terms of priority and deadlines.

# Goals
I can add new tasks or assignments i have and set their prioriites and deadlines
I can break down my projects and assignment into their specific workflows and steps involved
I can monitor on the progress of each task i've set to do and plan effectively towards completion
I can receive reminders about projects and tasks along with the individual workflows to reduce pressure while at the same time aligning work
I can receive last day emails or reminders to make sure i dont forget anything

# Techinical breakdown
I will likely build this out using a React/NextJS/TypeScript frontend and Firebase backend. I intend to use Prisma and PostgreSQL databases .
I would also like to use texting services or which i'll employ [Africastalking](https://africastalking.com) sms API. 
I will similarly use an emaling API
It will also be important to create a dynamic UI with suitable graphics to show tasks to make it less medial like a regular to do app and list workflows effectively
