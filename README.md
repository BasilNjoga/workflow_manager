# worklflow_manager
A web application to help you manage and set reminders for tasks, deadlines while breaking them down into the workflow involved

# What problem does this solve
As a student and for most organizations, you often have highly complicated projects and jobs with several steps involved that you would want to keep track of progress, get reminders for the tasks set, review deadlines and even asssign tasks to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency. 
The purpose of this application is to present a comprehensive workflow management system that will streamline and optimize the workflow processes for individuals and within organizations. The proposed system aims to enhance efficiency, collaboration, and productivity by automating routine tasks, providing real-time visibility into workflows, and facilitating effective communication among team members.
You can set deadlines and rank tasks based on priority. In this way you'll receive regular emails and text reminders for higher priority jobs and your dashboard shows jobs and task progress in terms of priority and deadlines.
You can similarly assign task to different people and in real time see the progress and workflows from the dashboard

# Goals
- I can add new projects or assignments i have and set their prioriites and deadlines
- I can break down my projects and assignment into their specific workflows and tasks involved
- I can automatically assign tasks to myself or team members based on predefined rules or availability
- I can monitor on the progress of each job and tasks completed or pending on visually applealling dashboard to display real-time status updates, key perfomance indicators and progress metrics
- I can receive reminders and notifications about projects and tasks along with the individual workflows to reduce pressure while at the same time aligning work
- I can receive last day emails or reminders to make sure i dont forget anything
- I can generate detailed reports and analytics to identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and track team and individual performance.


# Technical breakdown
I will likely build this out using a React/NextJS/TypeScript frontend and Firebase backend. I intend to use Prisma and PostgreSQL databases.
I would also like to use texting services for which i'll employ [Africastalking](https://africastalking.com) sms API. 
I will similarly use an emaling API
It will also be important to create a dynamic and visually appealing UI with suitable graphics to show tasks to make it less medial like a regular to do app and list workflows effectively
